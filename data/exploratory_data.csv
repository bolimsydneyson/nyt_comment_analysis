In short  we have had massive inflationary support of asset prices by printing money for the rich  but little actual fiscal (or monetary) stimulus of the sort that we would have normal price-inflationary pressures of expanding output as anti-inflationary (innovation lowering prices) competed with high consumer -- wage and income-based -- demand (tending to raise prices).  Because we have not had consumer-price inflation  apparently people lost their marbles and thought massive monetary stimulus was not inflationary.  The long ""bull run"" in the stock market is the natural result of printing money for the rich.  (More money needs to be printed for working folks.)

From a macro standpoint  it is absurd that during an 11 year expansion  similar to the 1990s in many respects  tax rates weren't increased enough to balance the Federal budget  and give the govt room to do deficit spending as a stimulus when it might actually be needed  such as now  or in 2008.  

Same with extremely low interest rates; allowing a business to borrow at even lower than low  which we have already  should have only small impact on that business' decision to borrow at all (for expansion that is now unlikely to happen for a while - a good project at say 3% interest won't be all that much better at 2.5% - the interest rate is only a small part of the overall costs of that project to the business  like tax rates are). 

In other words  as usual  the GOP has it all wrong.  Lower taxes don't reduce deficits  they increase them.  And deficits are a burden on future generations that we should only place on them when absolutely necessary - i.e. short-run emergencies that are paid back quickly.

One is the oil glut  and equally significant  the natural gas glut. The fracking boom and the several new European pipelines have over saturated the market.

What type of jobs?  $12 hour garbage jobs or real jobs with real pay and benefits?  Are these jobs being created by mortgaging our future?  Meaning interest rate cuts and massive spending at a time of full employment and a robust economy.  Then there is the aspect of cutting rules and regulations for corporate America.  What are the long term costs regarding climate change and income inequality?

I am not about to be a naysayer and dispute the massive number of jobs being created.  To do so would make me as big an ignoramus as republicans who said  ""I just don't believe the numbers or the President"" when Obama was in office.

493,Tom,Tom,"There is a lot I need to learn about Mike before I would be ready to vote for him.  I will watch the debate.  

Very intrigued by his student loan idea though.  If it really caps out at 5% of your income  perhaps there isn't interest on the loan and as long as you pay it all goes toward your principal.  Otherwise  your principal could get astronomical.

I still find it incredible that the richest country in the world has a government that will loan me money for an education but I have to pay it back with double the interest rate of a mortgage.  I think the US government can afford to let me pay the money back interest free as long as I make steady payments.  After all  with a better education my income level has a better chance of increasing and my tax contribution goes up - and the less government assistance services I need to rely on.  Instead of my student loans making me a burden on society  they should propel me into becoming a contributor.

I am not advocating for eliminating all student debt  but I am advocating for decreasing (what seems like an arbitrary) interest rate.  With no interest  I would have already paid back my loans  settled my debt with the US government  and been able to consume more and add to the economy (buy a house  contribute to local taxes  etc).  But here I am  still writing checks to the government.

The system now is based on predatory bank loan practices and is clearly broken.  I hope one of the candidates can address it rationally.",28,0,False,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/business/dealbook/michael-bloomberg-wall-street.html,520,0.0,2020-02-18 12:24:56,30,True,tom,0.0

Never dirty a pot or pan for one serving is my motto. Make enough for two or three days and put the extra portions in the freezer.  Cooking at the end of the work day can be very therapeutic.  On the days you are too tired or don't have time  take something you have prepared before out of the freezer.  That way you are not reliant on a delivery service and have something tasty and nutritious to eat.  Yesterdays leftovers can also serve as today's lunch. Nice way to save some pennies for the travel fund  new car etc.  Or just live within your means.

In my experience  dinner or lunch out with friends is more fun and usually tastier than something delivered to your door.  That is not to say that a delivery now and again can't fill a gap.

As if the containers themselves were not bad enough  most restaurants are automatically throwing multiple plasticware in with our deliveries even when we specifically tell them we DON'T need plasticware.  The fault lies with lazy consumers  most of whom WANT the plasticware  and so the restaurants err on the side of providing it with ALL orders (i.e.  they don't have time to check the online orders to see which few customers do Not want plasticware).

If the order was not right or arrived late  I could always reach customer service and they always gave me a credit to compensate for the error.  Then the mysterious ""service charges"" started randomly appearing on the bill  often doubling the delivery fee.  They were not disclosed on the site and seemed totally random.  It became harder and harder to reach customer service.  Even if you could  they offered nothing to compensate for the error.

I tried Grubhub as they expanded their local presence.  Again  my initial experiences were positive  and I used them regularly.  Then they started acting like DoorDash:  hidden charges  no customer service  etc.  I have pretty much stopped using all of them.

A word to those who are so critical of anyone's wanting such services:  We are not talking about having junk food delivered.  The appeal to me was that I could get food from excellent restaurants that had never before provided delivery.

It is not financial returns alone that underpins success  although finance is an essential resource without which businesses cannot succeed. 

In the main what drives businesses is “competitive advantage”.  Competitive advantage must be profitable  sustainable in the face of competition  and appropriable (the profits must be available to the investor and not used entirely to drive the engine).  

Porter  Treacy  Wiersema  Hax all luminaries  on the subject defined Competitive Advantage as being one or more of five ingredients (a) Product Leadership (b) Customer Intimacy
 (C) Operations and supply chain Efficiency (d) System Lock-in or customer Lock-in. Steve Jobs added the last (e) Key Staff Retention. 

Boeing failed on three out of the first four and concentrated on System Lock-in at any cost. The entire business model with Boeing then focused on being profitable and then taking those profits out (i.e appropriable) and not on sustainability.

Third problem...the CEO is talking about flying the 737 Max again. Give me a break! How stupid does he think the public is?  That plane will never fly again......because passengers won't pay to get on it. It doesn't matter that Boeing didn't bite the bullet early on and discontinue production.

Did you read about the protein molecules found on meteors recently? Like intergalactic spermatozoa  asteroids and meteorites fertilize planets when and if they become fertile. Earth became fertile. 

Now  600 million years later  humanity   like a deadly virus  has quickly spread across its planet killing every life form in its path  for profit. I've seen this happen on hundreds of thousands of planets throughout the universe. 

Few 'planet dominating species' survive. The beast within them  600 million years of genetic competition  compels their pathway through time. 

Typically  they over-populate  destroy their habitat  each other  and disappear forever while their planet slowly starts over. 

Very few planet dominating species find their way into the Universe. Very few of those survive. Time is running out for humanity. I am saddened. I had hoped humanity would find their path to the stars. They have imagined it but fail to honor it.

A small group of technologists attempt to attain a verifiable proof-of-principle and then protect the intellectual property (IP) developed.  That IP is then marketed to potential licensees.  The team of inventors then reap the rewards of the invention via royalties  license execution fees  etc.  But then  just like the Beatles  they break up.  The notion that start-ups increase employment has always been essentially false.

For example  Zume relied on automation to make pizzas.  I designed a robotic pizza toppings dispenser for Schwans in 2000.  At that time Schwans learned that automating the pizza process at the retail level does not provide a sustainable business model.  Human help is pretty cheap  and the automation is expensive and inflexible.  This knowledge was soon available to the entire food industry.  Why Zume never learned from Schwan's mistake is a complete mystery to me.  Evidently  they failed to inform themselves of the problems with their business model  or they were deliberately given a red-herring to dispose of start-up competitor.  They were certainly clueless as to the automation.

As for the inner-city scooter market  that was ill-conceived from the moment it happened.  It's a fad  and fads soon burn out.  It's not  and never was  a fundamental mode of transportation.

Most of the evidence cited for this trend relies on the bad portfolio of one bad investor (SoftBank)  the cannabis industry as a tech bellwether  and a handful of quotes from random VCs (there are literally thousands of VCs). Software is transforming every industry right now. There are thousands of high growth  money losing startups inside large profitable enterprises. Tech is not a monolith. The economics of Software-as-a-Service (high revenue retention rates that transformed volatile license software companies ten years ago into predicable revenue streams that look more like bonds)  was a major business model innovation that created a trillion dollars of value. It has perhaps been over extended now into industries that are fundamentally nonrecurring and we are perhaps seeing the shake out. That is a story maybe?

The reality is that Sonos came up with a facile technology that was doomed to have a short shelf-life once its market value was established. And now that they have demonstrated this market to the big players  their game is up. Playing the intellectual property victim is the only card they have left.

1354,Psa71,Psa,Every year for the past 20 or more years my husband and I have spent a night just before Christmas walking from Rockefeller Center  up 5th  over to Madison at 59th  up Madison to 62nd and ending at Burger Heaven where my husband would order either a hot dog and baked beans or a cheeseburger deluxe and a hot chocolate  the same he has ordered his entire life (he grew up around the corner and I grew up downtown)  and I would splurge on a burger (not deluxe....but I may have eaten a few of his fries when he wasn't looking).  Over the past 10 years  the walk has remained the same  but everything else has changed.  Rock Center is even more of a zoo as Saks added a light show.  Fifth Avenue doesn't have a Bendel's or Takashimaya or Searle or Gant.  There are no windows at Barney's to debate over.  So many storefronts on Madison are empty.  And now even Burger Heaven has gone.  As people who have grown up  met  gotten married and had children in this City  we are desolate at the loss of all that we knew.  Yes  much of what I listed above were commercial entities  but their loss is emblematic of our changing City which is increasingly sterile  homogenous  and very un-local.

For an extra $7.00 the french fries were very good  with a nice piece of lettuce and two thin slices of tomato. Two nice-size spears of sour pickle were a definite plus. The lemonade barely tasted of lemon and at $3.00 was not worth it. If  as has been mentioned in the comments  the owners also own the building  then perhaps this is a real estate story and has nothing to do with being unable to stay in business.

1500,RB,RB,Let's move beyond the obvious fact that Jennifer Lopez is attractive and a wonderful performer. What is troubling for me about the performance is the use of a stripper pole. Why is such a well received and athletic dancer and entertainer using this in her repertoire? Glamorizing and normalizing the exotic dancer industry is troubling. Many women (although not all) in this industry are trafficked  prostituted and in general vulnerable. As well we must consider that we are viewing Jennifer Lopez and evaluating her worth and assets  we do so as men and women in the context of our culture. Our society is one where women do not have true economic and educational equity. Women still receive the message in our culture that our primary worth is our sexual appeal. She is of course  beautiful and fit and a great performer  but our fascination and laudatory comments is more about our implicit approval of her fulfilling our society's ultimate role for women: sexually appealing beings.,876,16,True,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/style/jennifer-lopez-super-bowl.html,1078,2.0,2020-02-03 15:36:30,46,False,rb,2.0

I support universal early childhood education  but don’t support free childcare—and I’m someone who is paying a fortune with 3 kids in childcare.  The reason is that although a dual-working family is the right choice for us  I know it is not for many.  Offering free childcare amounts to a massive subsidy to working parents that is not available to parents who may wish to stay home.  We will end up making it harder and harder for families to choose whether to have a stay-at-home parent.

Let’s just subsidize parenthood.  Give money to parents and let them spend it on either childcare if they wish to work  or to help enable them to stay home w their kids if that is their preference.",26,1,False,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/upshot/universal-child-care-democratic-platform.html,293,2.0,2020-03-15 15:18:02,46,False,itsy,2.0
1676,Yojimbo,Yojimbo,"In this discussion  I would like us to take the focus off individual families and think above all as a society.

We pay for our shortcomings in early childhood education (ECE) with crime  prisons and insecurity. Spend a dollar now on ECE and save five (at least) later on the criminal justice system. 

There is as little consensus around universal childcare and pre-K as there is around Medicare for All.

By not teaching child development science along with rearing to high school students  is it not as though societally we’re implying that anyone can comfortably enough go forth with unconditionally bearing children with whatever minute amount  if any at all  of such vital knowledge they happen to have acquired over time?

Miller emphasizes that early education is vital to a child’s development but receiving it based on family income. In fact  Professor James J. Heckman’s recent study  Early Childhood Education  at the University of Chicago  addresses effects of early education programs in developing children and the benefit of government financing for the programs. Existing programs lack funding leading to rising cost of preschools. While most parents are aware of the importance of preschool  children often do not attend because their family cannot pay the cost. However  with a government funded program  families of any income could send their children to preschool. Additionally  a public preschool program not only helps children with their education but also with developing the social skills necessary as an adult.

These low-income students often end up having more struggles understanding the content later in school than students that attended adequate preschools because the low-income students are already behind the other students before kindergarten even starts.

In looking at all these variables associated with public preschool  a district could be looking at designating around 6-12 months for developing a curriculum and spending over a quarter of a million dollars on preschool education.

1794,Cynthia James-Richman,Cynthia,Holly NYC comments are spot on regarding the challenges of converting to online classes. Readers’ comments on the benefits and difficulties of distance education are all valid points. But the real discussion should focus on the immediate conversion of face-to-face courses to online instruction and learning. As a science instructor at a major university  I taught majors face-to face courses  hybrid courses and online courses. One online course typically enrolls about 650 students each semester. Adapting face-to-face courses to online instruction basically overnight is a major challenge to faculty  especially if faculty has never taught in online format. Learning management systems like Canvas and Blackboard are organizational backbones to courses  but it takes time and creativity to develop meaningful alternative curriculum. The laboratory sections cannot be replicated online and at this late date in the semester there is no catch up. Video conferencing is only one component of adapting instruction from a distance.

Video is available so that students and teacher may see each other  uploading of documents to be shared in the classroom  drawing tools and graphing grid are included and classes are all recorded for absentees or for those students wishing to view the lesson again.

One of my hopes is that such an online classroom might encourage more personalized interactions among the teacher and the students  something I find  often missing in college classrooms compared with high school classrooms.

I find that teaching an online class in this manner is the next best things to being in a classroom with students which certainly is the very best way to teach.

So university teachers in this environment where they teach smaller classes anyway would not have any extra time needed to prepare for such classes. They could simply continue teaching from home on the same schedule they already use and the students just come to the class using their browser.

To slow the pandemic spread so that our healthcare system won’t be overwhelmed and to allow time for antivirals and vaccines to be developed  we are forced to stop large gatherings of people.

1828,Fran,Fran,I've taught online and in person courses for graduate students for years. In the online world  it's essentially a flipped classroom model where students interact with prerecorded material (readings and lectures and uploading responses that I monitor and can reply to) for half the content and then a live session in zoom to practice  digest and discuss the material together. I find it to be very effective and students get a lot out of the course. I've also taught on the ground  and I find the experience different in one main way: There is less of the fluid give and take in the online class - student responses seem to be more structured (have to raise a hand)  rather than a free-flowing conversation. Sharing material  demonstrating something  watching video  having students present information is all essentially the same as in an actual classroom. And by the way  most material for courses is now online anyway  so this is less of a stretch than imagined. I am in the midst of taking in-person courses online  and I'm not too worried.,6,1,False,0,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/upshot/coronavirus-online-college-classes-unprepared.html,454,0.0,2020-03-13 15:56:43,52,False,fran,1.0

1830,Monsieur Wikipedia,Monsieur,In my experience  an online academic environment is far inferior to a traditional collegiate environment. There is no way that the professor gets to know her or his students to the same extent as in face-to-face classes. There  the professor can easily talk to students before and after class; humanize herself or himself by remarking on or discussing humorous personal or other public events  which he or she would not do online; and get to know the students' personalities and capabilities. Faculty form informal professor-student mentoring relationships. They also start clubs and organizations with students  devoted to common community service interests not necessarily related to the course. In short  online teaching  distance learning  non-residential campuses (granted residential campuses are not always possible due to costs to students)  etc  severely erode the benefits of a university education.

His private weekly private piano instruction may be trickier (he was also wondering how they will teach his conducting class!).

The debate of online vs. face-to-face seems like the wrong approach. It is not a zero sum binary choice  but has somehow turned into one.

However  when course design tries to hybridize the two  we start to see real instructional innovation  such as on-demand video instruction that can tutor students with difficult tasks and discussions or group activities that take place outside the classroom  but are still part of the classroom community.

What the sudden pivot to online courses  or as one Big 10 school calls it  “alternate learning”  shows is poor administrative policy towards course design and delivery. The other blind spot is seeing how some learners don’t have the bandwidth to participate  which goes beyond higher education.

Being able to interact with peers asynchronously  through web conferences  delivery speeches via video  or navigate social media are all skills that students can and should develop.

1894,Kay,Kay,Many aspects of traditional tertiary education are now done online in any event.  While this should make it easier for students because they can access materials at any time  I think the reality is that the standard of education has gone down significantly from when I was a student in the 1990s. Today  lectures are recorded in almost empty lecture theatres and are available to students online with PowerPoint slides.  Students need to be threatened with failure just to make them come to tutorials.  When students come to tutorials these days most haven’t even listened to the lecture  let alone done the acquired reading  making it difficult to generate class discussion because no one knows anything.  Yet  many students submit substandard work and still expect top marks and some them think they know more than their teachers.

1924,McKernon,McKernon,"I teach at NYU  and we are now teaching all our classes remotely for the duration of the pandemic. There's a crucial distinction between ""remotely"" and ""online"" that the author of this article failed to make.

We are teaching *remotely* - the professor is live  the students are present at their computers (each in their own home or apartment). We can see and react to the students  and they can see us and react to each other. They can ask questions and a two-way discussion ensues. The teaching is similar to what we do in regular classes but adapted as needed to reach someone over a computer screen.

An online class is one that is presented  moderated  and scored by a computer program. There is no live human responding to questions  and the students' questions are (at best) answered by an algorithm  or instead of getting an answer they are told to research the topic.

The distinction is critical  especially for students from overseas whose financial aid requires them to attend actual classes with an actual teacher. Remote teaching fulfills this requirement  online teaching does not.

There are still things to be solved with remote teaching  but despite having this sprung on us overnight  we're finding some solutions quickly.

A key first step is finding the right leaders to take on the herculean tasks this new FEMA office would have to solve. Put folks in charge of this office who've managed big  complex projects that involve difficult engineering problems.

Our defense department - our military forces - has systems already in place to manage large supply needs. Find the best leaders who are currently leading our defense logistics and put them in charge of this new FEMA office. That would go a long way towards solving this problem.

During WW2  General Marshall managed this function for our armed forces and really got the job done under herculean effort and under unbelievable stress. Find the General Marshall's of today  put them on this  give them the tools to work  and get out of the way.

This new office must also tighten numbers on critical equipment and protective gear needed to tackle this pandemic. Hospital associations and CDC can help on that.

2026,Robert B,Robert,"Trump is getting thrashed by the very governors  such as ""the woman in Michigan""  he now attacks.

This piece states that Trump is ""confronting a pandemic"". He's not  he's exploiting it. Trump's attacks on women are constant not just because he hates women  but because misogyny is an effective political tool throughout America.

However  lost on Trump is that it is not working here. The excellent leadership of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in fighting the covid-19 pandemic has led to her popularity rising over 20 points to 65%. Trump's vitriol  and Whitmer refusing to even address it  has not hurt her popularity at all.

In contrast  Trump rose a mere 5 points to 48%. It's unprecedentedly bad for a crisis of this magnitude  (George H. W. Bush jumped 35 points at the beginning of the Iraq War)  and poll analyst Harry Enten explained Trump's meager bump came ""from non-voters"". As FiveThirtyEight shows  Trump's already fallen to 45%.

Trump's not just totally incompetent  he's a true psychopathic narcissist. His signature traits are his absolute affection for himself  his forever trying to pretend he's far more than he is  his always expecting compliments from others  his blaming others for his constant deficiencies and failures  and finally  his total disregard for the welfare and lives of others.

Academia can be just as vicious and cruel as life in the private sector (where I spent 11 years). No one should kid themselves - academia is a business similar to other businesses - sharp elbows and all.

2.  Just because someone can continue teaching beyond 70 does not mean they should. I have encountered many faculty members over the years who continued working well past their ""sell by"" date. I do not intend on being one of them - the eccentric old guy with uncombed hair  a wild beard  ill-fitting clothes standing in front of a class with my fly unzipped because I forgot to check.

2141,Rosebud,Rosebud,"The current system is basically tenure or adjunct.  A new category would be nice – the multi-year teaching contract. 

Tenure and tenure-track jobs demand research  which creates the publish-or-perish problem.  Young tenure-track profs emphasize publication over teaching.  Most of the publications produced are not only superfluous navel gazing  they are also immature  unreadable sophomoric drivel wrapped up in post-modern gobble-dee-gook.  The act of teaching is where a scholar learns how to test and communicate ideas.  Teaching = bad.

The adjuncts have a different set of problems.  For starters  ObamaCare requires that employers give health benefits to anyone teaching more than approx. 2 classes (based on a difficult-to-translate equation).  As a result  the bastions of liberalism (colleges) won't hire adjuncts to teach more than 2 classes at a time.  So adjuncts must cobble together contracts from multiple employers.  Some colleges still pay as little as $3500 per class.  So if an adjunct teaches 4/4/2 (fall  spring  summer)  that could work out to $35 000 per year before taxes with absolutely no benefits  no travel expenses  no office  sometimes no reliable access to Xerox machines and infrastructure  leading to personal office supply expenses.  Not to mention that a 4/4/2 teaching schedule is outrageously excessive if you try to do a good job.  And  once you are an adjunct you can effectively say goodbye to a tenure track job.

2144,JD,JD,"Several commenters have wondered why  given high enrollments and increased tuition revenues  universities found themselves relying on cheap adjunct labor to staff courses.

In the realm of public institutions  the reason is simple: many states are no longer subsidizing education as they have in the past. In the past  80% of the UW system budget was funded by state tax dollars  and the rest was derived by very modest tuition. This is much of the reason why previous generations of students could self-fund their educations with summer work and perhaps a campus job during the academic year.

Now  only 20% of the university budget is supported by the state  forcing extreme competition for increased enrollments and tuition dollars. This competition  in turn  is driving universities to lure students in with increased amenities (cushy housing  scholarships  athletics facilities  extracurriculars  students clubs  etc.)  which further bloat the budgets. 

Did I mention the coming enrollment cliff? Birth rates dipped sharply around 2007  so there will be fewer students in 2025  and hence reduced tuition revenue. It's not a good idea to create new tenure lines now  as most schools will be facing major budget cuts in five years  before the newly hired can secure tenure. 

Guess who probably will get hired in the meantime? More adjuncts.

In an era now gone with the wind  a liberal arts education included familiarity with important  and complex  literature.  One had to concentrate and think about what the words on the page meant.

Writing was also taught  and writing referred to more than 140 or 280 character tweets.  Good writing was meant to be insightful  original  and usually grammatically correct.

Unfortunately  today things have changed.  Political correctness and groupthink are not merely acceptable  they are often mandatory.  A single out-of-the-box statement can derail a career  and hours must be spent to ensure that appropriate trigger warnings are provided in coursework.  The popular majors are those that focus on identity politics and victimization.

All this has served to thoroughly devalue a liberal arts degree.  It is this sea change that accounts for much of the decline in the job market for holders of advanced degrees.

2179,Paul-A,PaulA,"As someone who has been a professor for 30 years (in a tenured position and as an adjunct)  I'd like to add another perspective:

Get rid of the tenure system. It's the nexus of the problems in the profession.

Tenure forces colleges to retain faculty who:
- might not be particularly good teachers.
- might be burned out  coasting to retirement  or feel protected enough to no longer care about their job.
- might specialize in an area/skill that is no longer relevant to a field; or saddle a dept with someone whose skills no longer match a curriculum that has changed.

Apportioning tenured lines between departments makes departments and colleges unable to reapportion their resources to match changing needs.

On the other side: The tenure system makes finding a job in academia an all-or-nothing gambit. In most fields  you have only one or two shots at getting a tenured job: 1) within a few years of completing your degree; or 2) only if you attain high stature in your field. If you're an adjunct  no one will consider you after a few years: ""They must be no good  or else they'd have a tenured job by now."" If you look for a new job after 5-6 years in a job: ""They're probably not getting tenure at their current job; damaged goods.""  After tenure: ""Why are they leaving a tenured position? They must have done something bad.""

I enrolled in an excellent graduate program in the late 1960s and quickly realized there were almost no jobs for new PhDs in my field (literature) and that  in the unlikely event I did get a job  I'd never earn more than $3 000 a year. So I finished my master's degree and joined the corporate world. It took a while to get on a good career track  but I eventually had a very satisfying long-term career. When I retired  I went back to graduate school and got my PhD at age 72. Today I write as well as teach in local adult-learning programs. I love it; my students are smart and enthusiastic.

2235,Blue Stater,Blue,"I’ve been retired for about 20 years from a 45-year academic career (English). I see four main facets to a solution for this problem.

1. Borderline Ph.D. programs  in English at least  have to be closed. I advocated for this position in the late 70s while I was teaching at an urban university that had no business offering a Ph.D. program in English. No dice.

2. The vast number of superfluous administrators has to be drastically reduced.

3. The primacy of teaching  has to be restored   Teaching loads have to be increased; teaching evaluation has to be taken seriously. Class sizes must be reduced. When I was in graduate school  standard teaching loads at all but the top schools were four courses a semester. By the mid-60s  they were at three.  By the mid-80s they were at two and negotiable.  A three-course teaching load in research universities would do much to restore the perceived importance of teaching.  Teaching evaluation is a complex issue  but the system I left behind me was a joke.

4. Finally  retirement. The problem is that people teach beyond 70 and continue to hold academic tenure  blocking advancement for their juniors. I retired at 64 (coincidentally the same year my daughter got tenure at her university  in an ecologically satisfying move).

While it is true that the the percentage of tenured faculty has been diminishing over the year  the proportion of non-academic staff and administrators had ballooned.

The highest paid employees of a university tend to be the football coach and the president. At my institution  of the 20 highest compensated employees in 2016 (information publicly available via IRS form 990)  only 3 are faculty (and they are the lowest of those 20).

In essence  what has happened over the last few decades is ""administrator-capture"" of higher ed. As more students flooded the system  administrators hired low-cost contingent faculty to educate them  and used the excess cash to hire more of themselves and pay themselves more. The rest of the money was used on funding quality-of-life amenities for students and alumni (e.g. lazy rivers  stadiums  etc.).

It would be fascinating to compare relative salaries and admin budgets for higher ed in the 1970s versus today.

What was left unsaid was that just as adjunct professors get an unnecessarily raw deal  tenure and tenure-track faculty probably have it too sweet.

Yes  they are researching outside of their classroom time  but it is an incredibly cushy gig. 


A sustainable solution would be to reduce some of the perks for tenured faculty and even it out with adjuncts  as well as bringing on more “professors of practice” who are full time but not on the tenure-track and don’t have the same publishing expectations. We need full-time faculty who are fairly paid and experts in their fields  we don’t need to hire people for life and limit the school’s flexibility to pivot as students’ needs and interests change.

Management wants to minimize the amount they pay workers  which then forces them to shop at discount outlets that - ahem - sell at a lower price because the goods are made by minimizing the cost of human labor.

Either that or shop online and buy from Amazon  who minimizes the human cost through automated distribution centers. How long before your pizza order is delivered by a robot or flying drone?  That will happen when management deems the technology cheaper than paying people.

This is supposed to address the problem?  Seriously?  If the contractor wasn't paying its employees in the past  it won't in future  either  because the fines imposed by the government in the unlikely event they get caught are much smaller than what they'd owe if they paid what the law requires.

Think of what it took to make clothes before industrialization:

Hand spin thread - a job for old women or children
Weave cloth - a man or woman's job
Cut cloth and sew clothes (by hand) 

Everything in the process took time and effort.  Quilts were a way to use the scraps of cloth left over.   The scraps were worth too much to waste.

Even when industrialization automated thread and cloth production  the cutting of clothes and sewing them took time.  
Sewing machines were the first 'appliances' bought by most households.  First pedal driven and then electric  they greatly sped the process of making clothes.

Even when clothes became 'factory made' they were meant to last because they were NOT cheap.  Shirts had replaceable collars and cuffs - the parts that showed wear first.   

Even in my youth - the 1950's and 60's children were lucky to get two new sets of clothes a year.  And if you had an older sibling those could be hand-me-downs.  Outgrown clothes would be traded among extended families until they fell apart.  Mothers still mended clothes and often made their own.

It is very unlikely that cases would double every day because the virus has about a 5 day infection-transmission rate  so requires 5 days to double. Hence a 20% daily increase indicates an R (transmission rate) of 2. A 100% rate (which is a doubling) would be a ghastly R=5; even 50% (R=2.5) is terrifyingly high. These numbers all assume we are testing well- clearly not the case. 

My point is that early on what is being measured is our lack of testing capacity. When those curves level out or straighten  perhaps we get a real idea of reality. Sadly  our testing issue hamstring good interpretation of the data.

If testing is too limited (New Jersey?) to make confirmed cases a good metric  and deaths are too lagging  what about hospitalizations?

I believe we have become more aware of the importance of social distancing  or at least become more careful because the reality is closer to us  so hopefully it can change the course  at least a little. 

Here are a few random components that make the comparison and prediction near impossible. (1) Time-to-symptom: it's hard to know when a patient got infected. This makes it hard to know the impact of the measures (like school closure). (2) Time-to-death: Time to the fatality also varies a lot for each patient (because everyone is different and the condition when admitted varies). This makes it difficult to use death toll as a measure of progress of epidemic. (3) As we all know  lack of testing. (1) and (2) are not something we can control  but we did really bad for (3).

Wuhan's data is probably not to be used as reference point. In particular when they celebrated 0-new patients a few days ago. Statistically speaking  it's simply not true. 

Currently the only one reliable measure is the fatality rate from South Korea. The fatality for different age group from there is fairly reliable  although their number is based on much better managed health care system without overburden.

2636,TJ,TJ,I have been doing modelling based primarily on  mortalities since the backlog of testing (now apparently in the order of 7 days)  means that number of confirmed cases needs to be carefully interpreted.  Instead  I have been using the daily number of deaths as reported on Worldometers as a basis of analysis.  According to a couple of recent research papers  for people who die of the virus  the average time between infection and death is about 14 days.  This is due to the larger proportion of elderly and those with underlying conditions who die.  I then considered the most likely mortality rate.  Although a wide range has been reported  the higher rates are associated with situations where the health system was being overwhelmed and testing was only done on the more severe cases.  Imperial College propose a mortality rate of about 0.75% and Dr Fanuci  (ex-director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) has suggested a MR value of 1%.  Plugging those to values (1% MR) into the basic model suggests that the spread of infection in the US was about 800K on Mar 19th and now stands around 3 million.  If you correct for the 7 day backlog of test results  this implies that about 12% of the infection was detected on the 19th.

2650,MattZN,MattZN,"Charts based on non-random test results (i.e. things like 'confirmed cases') are basically worthless.  You need random population sampling (testing) to actually get decent statistics.

Charts based on mortality are marginally more useful  because most of the deaths caused by COVID-19 in the U.S. will be properly counted as being caused by COVID-19.

In particular  a death represents someone who was infected roughly 30 days prior (+/- 10 days  for a rough mean).  You can use this back-date and compare against the date that the state/county/city implemented strong measures  along with the exponential rate of increase calculated from prior deaths  to calculate how many people will die up to 30 days in the future.

When something changes  such as policy  it gets a bit more murky because you won't have any good data on the effects the policy change has on the infection rate for at least 30 days after the policy change is made.

So  I'm afraid  most of these graphs are just not all that useful.  The error bars have got to be massive  there aren't enough data points  and there is no random population testing to drive the sorts of comparisons you are trying to make.  Its better not to publish them at all  frankly.

That said  is not the number of Covid cases requiring hospitalization more important to the measurement of the spread and the impact on health systems than the total cases? If in my area we test 100 people and have 100 positives  but none requiring hospitalization  that is vastly different on many front than 100 tests with 40% requiring hospitalization.

Also  now that testing is ramping up e need a data point that adjusts for more tests rather than a spreading infection. Again  if 100 test yesterday revealed 40 positives and today we tested 200 and had 60 positives the infection rate has actually gone down.

In fact  having a growing number positives compared to hospitalizations is  good if there is immunity since those people are out of the danger zone and can work.

Germany's low mortality rate is misleading. For example  it doesn't attribute deaths to COVID-19 unless the patient had a confirmed infection prior to death; Germany will not perform an autopsy to determine whether COVID-19 was a factor after the fact.

Most importantly  from the standpoint of the analysis offered here  is the obvious problem with testing  as ""blue states have conducted more tests per capita than red states"". It means ""that the large majority of coronavirus cases remain undetected""  and that ""the lower rate of cases in red states"" is ""an artifact of less testing"" in those states.

Therefore  almost all available data from red states is from full-blown infections  in which case testing is only done After a patient is already admitted to a hospital and is often in the ICU.

My cousin works in a medical examiner's office and  like his colleagues across the US  has been seeing a horrifying surge of ""unexplained pneumonia"" deaths in the country since at least early February if not late January. However  with testing still so inadequately low in America  these pneumonia deaths were never actually tested for COVID-19 even though the patients showed all the hallmark symptoms and had no other causative agent.

As a result  the American death rate for COVID-19 is grossly underreported  and the only way to see this is to count up the otherwise mysterious skyrocketing of deaths from ""pneumonia of unknown cause"". In fact one of the reasons why Italy and Spain seem to have a higher COVID-19 death rate than the US on the surface is that  contrary to the USA  both Italy and Spain do extensive postmortem COVID-19 testing especially for pneumonia patients to get an actual cause of death. The US does not and is woefully deficient in both postmortem COVID-19 testing and in hospitals.

He would prefer to get companies to volunteer to help using the threat of using National Defense Act as 'leverage'.  I think he is seeing what would be just the temporary repurposing of factories as representing the nationalization of factories or 
'creeping' Socialism. This is the very ideology he planned to run against in the coming election. He wants to appear to stand for free enterprise and against ""big government""  even in these perilous times  when an organized national effort to fight the virus is urgently needed  hence comes the frequent rhetoric about how governors have to handle much on their own.

My cousin was gravely sick  but some of his colleagues continued to work in wheelchairs and hooked up to high flow oxygen  because there was nobody else who could do some emergency procedures.

Do NOT use nebulizers and spirometers on ANYONE  and take great care during intubations.  Examine the ventilation systems.  You are unlikely to have enough negative pressure rooms.  The virus can be transmitted by stool and vomitus.  This is a very common mode of transmission of SARS in hospitals  and faulty drainage systems is a big risk.  Make sure the toilet seat is covered before flushing  since virus is aerosolised and can stay alive suspended for a considerable time.
